# Malicious-URL-ML-Predict
ML model developed to predict malicious URLs

In today’s digital age, one of the increasingly common challenges users face is 
determining whether a URL is safe to click. We constantly encounter links—whether in emails, 
on social media platforms, or through everyday web browsing—and each one presents a 
potential security risk. Malicious URLs can lead to phishing attacks, data theft, or unintentional 
downloads of harmful software. This project seeks to address that risk by leveraging machine 
learning techniques to identify and classify potentially dangerous URLs, thereby helping users 
avoid scams and protect their devices.
At the core of this project lies the application of artificial intelligence, particularly within 
the field of machine learning. A neural network model will be developed to handle the 
classification task—distinguishing between benign and malicious URLs based on extracted 
features. While traditional AI methods will not be employed for the preprocessing of raw URL 
data, the model will incorporate built-in text vectorization techniques to transform the various 
string-based components of each URL into a format suitable for learning. This integrated 
approach enables the system to process complex patterns in URL structures, improving its 
accuracy and effectiveness in detecting threats. After the development of this model, it will be 
compared to previous works to evaluate how well it performs.
